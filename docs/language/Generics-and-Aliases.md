# Generics and type aliases

## Generic types

Structs, qualifiers, and arrays can all refer to generic types, using the following syntax:

```
// Struct with generic types S and  T
struct Pair<S, T> {
    first: S,
    second: T
}

// Qualifier can be as generic as type or less. This governs which `Pair`s the qualifier can apply to.
qualifier Something<S, T> of Pair<S, T>
qualifier FirstStr<T> of Pair<Str, T>
qualifier Ints of Pair<Int, Int>
```

Using qualifiers and generics we can implement the equivalent of a `Result` type from Rust. `core` ships exactly this pair, so you do not have to declare it — but nothing about it is built in, and the declarations are just:

```
provenance qualifier Ok<T> of T
provenance qualifier Err<T> of T

let result: Ok Int | Err Str = get_age()

if result is Ok {
    // `result` is `Ok Int` here
    println("Age is ${result}")
} else { // No need to check that it's Err, because all other options are excluded by the other branches
    // `result` is `Err Str` here
    println("Something went wrong calculating age: ${result}")
}
```

Because neither of these are `with` the other, it follows that nothing can be both at the same time. However, because the type of the qualifier is generic, it's possible for _it_ to be a qualified type:

```
let result: Ok (Ok Str | Err Int) | Err Bool = some_function()
```

This nesting is generally discouraged. There is nothing wrong with having multiple qualifiers over various types, such as:

```
let result: Ok Str | Err Str | Err Bool = some_function()
```

This allows us to accumulate failure modes and handle them at a higher level of the code. Because of generic qualifiers, Salvo also supports more precise checks for unions:

```
let result: Ok Str | Err Str | Err Bool = some_function()

if result is Err Str {
    // `result` is of type `Err Str`
}

if result is Err {
    // `result` is of type `Err Str | Err Bool`
}
```

## Type aliases

Type aliases can be convenient for making union and tuple types more readable. You can use generics when declaring a type alias:

```
type Result<S, T> = Ok S | Err T
```

Type aliases need to be imported like everything else (see below for details).
